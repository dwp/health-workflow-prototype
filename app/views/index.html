        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Problem statement</h3>

        <p>The current process for handling cases through HAS is increasingly unsustainable as service demand grows. It relies heavily on manual workarounds, which are time-consuming, error-prone, and frustrating for users. This inefficiency not only reduces productivity but also contributes to staff dissatisfaction, affecting retention and recruitment efforts. </p>

        <p>Evidence suggests that users may selectively process easier cases, leading to uneven workload distribution and reduced accountability. The lack of structured case ownership and personal work management tools further exacerbates this issue.</p>

        <p>The existing system does not leverage automation, missing opportunities to streamline workflows, reduce human error, and improve overall service delivery. Automation could enable:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>Smart case allocation based on complexity, urgency, and user expertise</li>
          <li>Automated tracking and reporting, reducing administrative burden</li>
          <li>Workflow standardization, ensuring consistency and fairness</li>
          <li>Enhanced user dashboards, promoting ownership and visibility of tasks</li>
          <li>Time-saving integrations, allowing staff to focus on higher-value work</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Without addressing these challenges, the department risks increased operational costs, reduced service quality, and ongoing difficulties in maintaining a skilled and motivated workforce.</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>Integration of allocting a task and 'open tasks'</li>
      <li>Table updates to include 'Due in' to give users an idea of priority</li>
      <li>Notification if a new task has come in for a case previously worked on</li>
      <li>Option to mark multiple tasks as complete</li>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Appointee details - April 2025 - vxx</h2>
        <strong class="govuk-tag govuk-tag--blue">In development</strong>
        <br><br>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Problem statement</h3>

        <p>If someone claiming PIP or WCA is incapable of managing their own affairs due to mental incapacity or severe physical disability, then an appointee may be assigned. The appointee will act on behalf of the claimant for benefit purposes.

          <p>An appointee can be an individual, or an organisation.</p>

          <p>However, there have been instances where the claimant has been contacted rather than the appointee.</p>

          <p>Agents need to access various systems using manual processes in order to find out if an appointee has been assigned to a referral.</p>

          <p>This is time consuming for the agent. It opens up for error and risks contact with the incorrect person.</p>

          <p>This costs the department money and causes lack of trust </p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Hi-level design decisions</h3>

          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>Addition of 'Appointee' section into 'Claimant details'</li>
            <li>Addition of 'Appointee' into side nav</li>
            <li>Use of 'Warning text' in 'Personal details' when appointee is registered</li>
            <li>Appointee details are displayed to agent in 'Appointee' section</li>
            <li>'No appointee' message added to 'Appointee' section when no appointee is registered</li>
