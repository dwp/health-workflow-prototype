        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Problem statement</h3>

        <p>*Needs updating</p>

        <p>In 2023 Chaffinch were assigned work to look into how task management could be implemented in the Health Assessment Service (HAS), with the intention that this would be a new way of working, and to eventually replace the current status-based approach. The first stage of this has been completed and the Review further medical evidence task is now live.</p>

        <p>This new approach aims to improve how information and evidence is received, processed through HAS and subsequently how it is allocated to a user, in order to process the referral efficiently, reducing cost, time and also to reduce the need for existing admin workarounds.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Problem statement</h3>

        <p>If someone claiming PIP or WCA is incapable of managing their own affairs due to mental incapacity or severe physical disability, then an appointee may be assigned. The appointee will act on behalf of the claimant for benefit purposes.

          <p>An appointee can be an individual, or an organisation.</p>

          <p>However, there have been instances where the claimant has been contacted rather than the appointee.</p>

          <p>Agents need to access various systems using manual processes in order to find out if an appointee has been assigned to a referral.</p>

          <p>This is time consuming for the agent. It opens up for error and risks contact with the incorrect person.</p>

          <p>This costs the department money and causes lack of trust </p>
