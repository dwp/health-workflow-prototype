        Referral state Model
      </h1>

      <p>This prototype shows the minimum viable product (MVP) using a referral state model with the aim of simplifying how a referral can be pushed end-to-end through the Health Assessment Service, with a benefit-agnostic approach.  It allows a user to do the following: </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Prototype</h2>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>view a list of referrals that have come into the health assessment service via the referral gateway </li>
        <li>Show benefit type so Case Manager can identify a WCA referral as these have a different clerical process in place</li>
        <li>Show referral date so a Case Manager can identify whether a referral needs chasing</li>
        <li>perform necessary identity checks</li>
        <li>move the referral to the next stage by having the ability to update the status of a referral as it moves through the assessment process</li>
        <li>start assessment if the referral is in 'paper based review' or 'assessment booked'</li>
        <li>view report if the referral is in 'awaiting decision' or 'done'</li>
      </ul>
