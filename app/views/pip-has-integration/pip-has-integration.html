        PIP HAS integration
      </h1>

      <p>This prototype helps visualise what the referral details area in HAS will look like throughout the stages of integrating with PIP New Service. The prototype will also aid Service Readiness colleagues with preparing relevant training material ready for PIP New Service.

          <li>This prototype reflects the referral and claimant data that will be displayed in HAS for PIP New Service thin slice integration. </li>
          <li>Referral and claimant data will be pulled from PIP into HAS via an API. The majority of data fields will not be editable, as HAS will always retrieve the most up to date data from PIP.</li>
          <li>However, there will be certain 'change of circumstances' fields which PIP cannot supply and is crucial to HAS, such as 'Safety measures' and 'Interpreter' information. So these fields must remain editable.</li>
          <li>New data fields that have been added (in addition to what is present in the live environment currently) include Date of death (still TBC), GP details, Other specialist or medical contacts, Full name, and Residential address (replacing current postcode field, for PIP thin slice cases only). </li>
          <li>The 'Preferred name' field has been removed because PIP cannot supply this data for September 2024</li>
          <li>The intention is, for Septemebr 2024 we display in HAS the most crucial and highest priority data that PIP can supply to us. But overtime we work with PIP to incrementally display more referral and claimant data in HAS. </li>
